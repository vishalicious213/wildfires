# Wildfire Tracker

This is a React Hooks application based on a project from Traversy Media. It makes use of the following technologies:

* NASA Open API for wildfire data 
* Google Maps API to generate the world map
* Google-Map-React to communicate with Google Maps API
* Iconify to provide wildfire icons

API keys for Google Maps API are stored in an environment variable, so they're not exposed.
